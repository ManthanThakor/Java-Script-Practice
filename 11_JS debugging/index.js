// JavaScript Debuggers
// Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.

// Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.

// With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.

// Normally (otherwise follow the steps at the bottom of this page), you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.

console.log("debugger activated");

// Six other escape sequences are valid in JavaScript:

// Code	Result
// \b	Backspace
// \f	Form Feed
// \n	New Line
// \r	Carriage Return
// \t	Horizontal Tabulator
// \v	Vertical Tabulator
