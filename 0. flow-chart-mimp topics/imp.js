Understand how to declare variables, work with different data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.

@ Operators and Expressions:
Learn about arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators. Understand how to use them in expressions.

Control Flow:
Master control flow statements like if-else, switch-case, and loops (for, while, do-while) to control the flow of execution in your code.

Functions:
Understand functions, function declarations, function expressions, arrow functions, and how to pass arguments and return values from functions.

Scope and Closures:
Learn about variable scope, lexical scope, and closures. Understand how closures work and their practical applications.

Arrays and Objects:
Dive into working with arrays and objects. Learn about array methods (e.g., map, filter, reduce) and object properties/methods.

DOM Manipulation:
Understand the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript. Learn about selecting elements, modifying content, attributes, and styles.

Error Handling:
Understand error handling mechanisms in JavaScript, including try-catch blocks. Learn how to handle errors gracefully in your code.

ES6+ Features:
Familiarize yourself with modern JavaScript features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later versions, such as arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators, and classes.

Modules and Modularization:
Learn about JavaScript modules and how to organize your code into reusable modules. Understand the import and export syntax.

Regular Expressions:
Understand regular expressions (regex) and how to use them for pattern matching and string manipulation tasks.

Debugging and Testing:
Master debugging techniques to identify and fix errors in your code. Learn about testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine to write unit tests for your JavaScript code.
